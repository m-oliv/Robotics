# Robotics
Some arduino code samples that we created in the robotics sessions.

Code samples:
- line.ino - this code allows the 3pi to move in a straight line.
- square.ino - this code allows the 3pi to move in a square.
- calibration.ino - the code we used to do a simple calibration of the 3pi.
- count_laps.ino - a modification of the PID controller provided with the 3pi code samples.
This modification allows for the 3pi to count the number of laps in a track.

Here's a video of a 3pi, programmed with one of our simples controllers, running in a track:
